            <p class="p-0">INTRODUCTION<br>Earth is the fifth largest planet in the solar system, yet it stands out as the only planet with liquid water on its surface. Earth is the largest among the four rocky planets that are closest to the Sun, all of which are made up of rock and metal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-2">
            <p class="p-2">ORBIT<br>As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes a rotation every 23.9 hours and takes 365.25 days to make one full trip around the Sun. <br>This extra quarter day leads to the addition of a leap day every four years to keep our calendar aligned.<br>Earth's axis is tilted at 23.4 degrees relative to its orbital plane, causing the seasons.<br> When the northern hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it experiences summer, while the southern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa six months later. During spring and fall, both hemispheres receive roughly equal sunlight.</p>

            <p class="p-11">SIZE<br> Earth, with an equatorial diameter of 7,926 miles (12,760 kilometers), is the largest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest overall in the solar system.
                <br>Located about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the Sun, Earth is exactly one astronomical unit (AU) away, as one AU represents the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit makes it easier to compare the distances of other planets from the Sun.
                It takes roughly eight minutes for sunlight to reach our planet.</p>

        <div class="frame-3">
            <p class="frame3-p">SURFACE<br>
                Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Its lithosphere consists of tectonic plates that move constantly, causing earthquakes when they interact. 
                
                Earthâ€™s global ocean covers nearly 70% of the surface and is about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) deep, containing 97% of the planet's water. Most volcanoes are underwater, including Hawaii's Mauna Kea, which is taller than Mount Everest when measured from base to summit. Earth's longest mountain range is also submerged beneath the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, extending four times longer than the Andes, Rockies, and Himalayas combined.</p>

            <p class="f4-p">MOON <br>
                Earth is the only planet that has a single moon, which is the most luminous and familiar object in our night sky. On average, the Moon is located 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) from Earth, allowing enough space for 30 Earth-sized planets to fit between the two.</p>
