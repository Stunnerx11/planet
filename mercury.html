            <p class="p-0"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter </p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-1">
            <p class="p-1">SIZE<br>With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-2">
            <p class="p-2">ORBIT<br>Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-11">
            <p class="p-11">ROTATION<br> Mercury follows a very eccentric, elliptical orbit, bringing it within 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) of the Sun at its closest point and stretching out to 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) at its farthest. It orbits the Sun in just 88 days, racing through space at an incredible speed of 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet in the solar system. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to complete one rotation. However, when it's closest to the Sun in its elliptical orbit, sunrise and sunset don't follow a normal pattern. In some regions, the Sun briefly rises, sets, and rises again. A full solar day on Mercury, from sunrise to sunset, lasts 176 Earth days—over two Mercury years. With an axial tilt of just 2 degrees, Mercury spins nearly upright, so it does&#39;t experience seasons like other planets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-3">
            <p class="frame3-p">SURFACE<br>The planet features grayish-brown terrain with bright "crater rays" from impacts. Temperatures range from 800°F (430°C) during the day to -290°F (-180°C) at night, with water ice possibly present in permanently shadowed polar craters. Located about 35.98 million miles (57.91 million km) from the Sun, Mercury has a day length of 58.6 Earth days. The planet is shrinking as its cooling core solidifies, creating large scarps and evidence of tectonic activity, including potential "Mercuryquakes."</p>
