            <p class="p-0">INTRODUCTION<br>Neptune, the eighth and most distant planet, is a cold, dark ice giant with supersonic winds. It's over 30 times farther from the Sun than Earth and was first discovered in 1846. Neptune completed its first full orbit in 2011, taking 165 years. Sunlight on Neptune is about 900 times dimmer than on Earth, making high noon appear like dim twilight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-1">
            <p class="p-1">SIZE<br>Neptune's equatorial diameter is 30,775 miles (49,528 km), making it four times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be as big as a baseball. Located 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion km) from the Sun, it takes sunlight 4 hours to reach Neptune.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-2">
            <p class="p-2">ORBIT<br>Neptune's day lasts about 16 hours, while a full orbit around the Sun takes 165 Earth years (60,190 days). Occasionally, Neptune is farther from the Sun than Pluto, as Pluto's eccentric orbit brings it inside Neptune’s orbit for 20 years every 248 Earth years. However, they can never collide due to their synchronized orbits. Neptune’s 28-degree axial tilt causes it to experience seasons like Earth, but each season lasts over 40 years due to its long orbit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-11">
            <p class="p-11">MOON<br>Neptune has 16 known moons, with the largest, Triton, whoch is discovered just 17 days after finding Neptune. Triton is unique among large moons in the solar system as it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet’s rotation (retrograde orbit), suggesting it may have once been a separate object captured by Neptune.
               </p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-3">
            <p class="frame3-p">SURFACE<br>Neptune, an ice giant, consists mostly of a dense fluid of water, methane, and ammonia, surrounding a small rocky core. It’s the densest of the giant planets. Beneath its cold clouds, there may be an ocean of super-hot water, kept from boiling by extreme pressure. Neptune has no solid surface; its atmosphere of hydrogen, helium, and methane gradually transitions into a fluid layer above the core.</p>
