            <p class="p-0">INTRODUCTION<br>
              Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a frigid, dusty, desert-like world with a fragile atmosphere. This ever-changing planet experiences seasons, has polar ice caps, dormant volcanoes, vast canyons, and varying weather conditions. It's often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to iron minerals in the Martian soil that oxidize, creating a reddish hue on its surface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-1">
            <p class="p-1">MOON<br>
              Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. Due to their low mass, their gravitational pull is too weak to shape them into spheres, giving them a distinctive, irregular, potato-like form.
              Phobos, the larger and closer moon of Mars, is cratered and moving toward the planet, expected to crash or break apart in 50 million years.
               Deimos, smaller and farther away, has a smoother surface due to loose dirt filling its craters</p>

        <div class="frame-2">
            <p class="p-2">ORBIT<br>Mars takes 687 Earth days (or 669.6 sols) to orbit the Sun, while its day lasts about 24.6 hours. With a 25-degree axial tilt like Earth, Mars experiences distinct seasons, but its elliptical orbit results in more extreme seasonal variations. Northern spring lasts 194 sols, while autumn is only 142 sols. Over time, changes in Mars' axial tilt may have caused climate shifts and methane releases, contributing to past warming periods that allowed water to flow.</p>

            <p class="p-11">SIZE AND DISTANCE<br>
              Mars, with a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), is roughly half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be comparable to a raspberry. Located an average of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers) from the Sun, Mars is 1.5 astronomical units (AU) away. At this distance, sunlight takes about 13 minutes to reach Mars from the Sun. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-3">
            <p class="frame3-p">SURFACE<br>
              Mars features a range of colors, predominantly red due to iron rusting in its surface dust. Its surface area is similar to Earth's dry land, shaped by volcanic activity and dust storms. Notable formations include Valles Marineris, a canyon system over 3,000 miles long, and Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system. Evidence suggests a watery past with ancient river valleys and lakebeds, while today, water exists mainly as ice beneath the surface and as briny water flowing seasonally.
