            <p class="p-0">INTRODUCTION<br>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is the second-largest planet in the solar system. While other gas giants like Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune also possess rings, Saturn's are especially striking, leading to its nickname, the "Ringed Planet."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-1">
            <p class="p-1">MOON AND ORBITS<br>Saturn has 146 moons in its orbit.

              Saturn's rings are made of ice and rock fragments from comets, asteroids, or shattered moons, shaped by the planet's gravity. They range in size from tiny grains to mountain-sized chunks and appear mostly white from Saturn's cloud tops. The ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet but is only about 30 feet (10 meters) thick. The main rings are labeled A, B, and C, with fainter rings D, E, F, and G separated by the Cassini Division.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-2">
            <p class="p-2">ORBIT<br>Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system, lasting about 10.7 hours. It completes an orbit around the Sun in roughly 29.4 Earth years (10,756 Earth days). With an axial tilt of 26.73 degrees, Saturn experiences seasons similar to Earth, which has a tilt of 23.5 degrees.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-11">
            <p class="p-11">SIZE AND ROTATION<br>Saturn has an equatorial diameter of approximately 74,897 miles (120,500 kilometers), making it nine times wider than Earthâ€”comparable to a volleyball if Earth were a nickel. Situated about 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun, Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units (AU) away, with sunlight taking about 80 minutes to reach the planet. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-3">
            <p class="frame3-p">SURFACE<br>Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, with a dense core of iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material. It has a layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid metallic hydrogen. Remarkably, Saturn's average density is less than water, meaning it could "float" in a large enough bathtub.

              As a gas giant, Saturn lacks a true surface, consisting mainly of swirling gases and liquids. Any spacecraft entering the planet would be crushed or vaporized due to extreme pressures and temperatures. Its atmosphere includes hydrogen, helium, and water, while its rings are primarily composed of water ice</p>
