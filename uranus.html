            <p class="p-0"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, has the third-largest diameter in the solar system and spins almost on its side at a nearly 90-degree angle to its orbit. This ice giant is characterized by its cold and windy atmosphere, and is considered as the coldest planet in the solar system</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-1">
            <p class="p-1"><b>MOONS AND RINGS</b><br>Uranus has 28 known moons, with the inner ones composed of about half water ice and half rock. The outer moons' composition is still uncertain, but they are likely captured asteroids.<br>Uranus has two ring systems: nine narrow, dark grey inner rings and two outer rings, with the innermost being reddish and the outer one blue. The rings are named Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu, with some larger rings surrounded by dust belts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-2">
            <p class="p-2"><b>ORBIT</b><br>Uranus rotates once every 17 hours and orbits the Sun in about 84 Earth years. Its unique tilt of 97.77 degrees, likely from a past collision, causes extreme seasons with 21 years of sunlight followed by 21 years of darkness at each pole. Uranus also rotates in the opposite direction of most planets, alongside Venus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-11">
            <p class="p-11"><b>SIZE AND DISTANCE</b><br>Uranus has an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), making it four times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Uranus would be similar in size to a softball. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), or about 19 astronomical units , with sunlight taking approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach it. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-3">
            <p class="frame3-p"><b>SURFACE</b><br>Uranus is an ice giant primarily composed of a dense fluid of water, methane, and ammonia above a small rocky core, with temperatures near the core reaching 9,000°F (4,982°C). It appears blue-green due to methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Lacking a true surface, Uranus consists mostly of swirling fluids, making it inhospitable for spacecraft.</p>
