            <p class="p-0">INTRODUCTION<br>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and our nearest planetary neighbor. It is considered as the hottest planet in our solar system and is often referred to as Earth's twin.Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. </p>

        <div class="frame-2">
            <p class="p-2">ORBIT<br>A "day" on Venus lasts 243 Earth days, even longer than its year of 225 Earth days. Due to its slow rotation, sunrise to sunset takes 117 Earth days, with the Sun rising in the west and setting in the east because Venus rotates backward relative to Earth.
                Unlike Earth, which has seasons due to its 23-degree axial tilt, Venus experiences no significant seasonal changes, as its tilt is only three degrees, too slight to affect temperatures or sunlight intensity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-11">
            <p class="p-11">SIZE<br> Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), or 0.72 astronomical units. Sunlight takes approximately six minutes to reach Venus. The planet is nearly the same size as Earth, with an equatorial diameter of about 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers) compared to Earth's 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-3">
            <p class="frame3-p">SURFACE<br>If we sliced Venus and Earth in half and compared them, they would look quite similar, each having an iron core, a hot rocky mantle, and a thin crust that can change shape and erupt into volcanoes. Earth’s surface is reshaped by plate tectonics, a process that may have occurred on Venus as well, with current evidence suggesting subduction could be taking place.<br>While both planets share a similar internal structure, Venus has a harsh atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide (96%) and nitrogen (3.5%), along with trace gases, creating a stark contrast with Earth’s environment.
