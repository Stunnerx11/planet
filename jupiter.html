            <p class="p-0">INTRODUCTION<br>Jupiter is  the largest planet in our solar system; it could hold 1,000 Earths inside if it were hollow. It is formed from the leftover dust and gases of the Sun’s creation 4.6 billion years ago, it is also the oldest planet. Remarkably, Jupiter has the shortest day of all planets, completing a rotation on its axis in just 10.5 hours.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame-1">
            <p class="p-1">SIZE<br>SIZE AND DISTANCE
              Jupiter has a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), making it 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be comparable to a basketball. 
              
              Located about 484 million miles (778 million kilometers) from the Sun, Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away. At this distance, sunlight takes 43 minutes to reach the planet.</p>

        <div class="frame-2">
            <p class="p-2">ORBIT<br>ORBIT
              Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system, taking just about 10 hours to complete one rotation. It orbits the Sun once every 12 Earth years, or approximately 4,333 Earth days. 
              
              The planet's equator is tilted only 3 degrees relative to its orbital path, allowing it to spin almost upright and resulting in milder seasonal changes compared to other planets.</p>

        <div class="frame-11">
            <p class="p-11">MOON<br>
              Jupiter has 95 officially recognized moons, including the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. These moons, known as the Galilean satellites.
              Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system
               Ganymede is the largest moon  even exceeding the size of Mercury. 
              Callisto has only a few small craters, suggesting minimal surface activity. 
              Europa, which may harbor a liquid-water ocean beneath its icy crust

        <div class="frame-3">
            <p class="frame3-p">SURFACE<br>Jupiter primarily consists of hydrogen and helium, resembling the Sun's composition. Its atmosphere compresses hydrogen gas into a liquid, forming the largest ocean in the solar system. At greater depths, high pressure strips electrons from hydrogen, creating a conductive liquid metallic hydrogen that, combined with rapid rotation, generates a strong magnetic field.As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids.</p>
